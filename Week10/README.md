# HW Due Tuesday Week11

Now that we have learned `Context` and refactored our API version of the `Todo App`, let's practice it one more time! Refactor V1 of the `Todo App` to use `Context`. You will have to do the same steps as we did to refactor V2 which used `axios` and `JSON Server`. The version you make will be V4, which uses Local and Application wide state, but remove the `prop drilling` in favor of `Context`.

## Begin Thinking about your Final Project

It's Week10 already! Your final project presentations are Week14. You have a lot of new topics to incorporate like Context and data persistence with an API and Database.In the next few weeks we will be delving into the world of Redux.

One option, is to take our bare bones `Todo List App` and reskin it as something more specific. This would obviously include styling but more importantly, adding more input fields to make the usage of your app more specific. For example: you could turn the generic todo list into an exercise tracker. Maybe you add some color coding, or a way to filter or search existing todos. If you choose this option, you MUST add new fields! A simple styling pass will not suffice.

The other option is to build a new tool, game, or site that utilizes at least 2 topics from the second half of the semester. This option is more open, but make sure you dedmonstrate working knowledge of Context, JSON Server, and/or Redux! If you are unsure about your topic, feel free to reach out.
