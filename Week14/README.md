# Hello Typescript!

Today's lesson we are going to just jump right in and start coding. We will have a slightly different setup today to start.

1. First, we are going to generate a project with Vite today, and utilize its built in Typescript Template:
   ```bash
   npm create vite location-search -- --template react-ts
   ```
2. Now, `cd` into your new project and run the following:
   ```bash
    npm install
    npm run dev
   ```
3. You'll notice when you run your dev server, the port is totally different!
4. Now, we need to install `Tailwind.css` the `Vite` way:

5. Now it's time to get our boilerplate in for our project files and off we go!
