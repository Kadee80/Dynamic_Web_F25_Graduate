# Todo List App

Today we will build our most involved app yet, using concepts and skills we have already covered. Then, we will refactor it to introduce data persistence with an outside API and learn how to use `JSON Server` in the process. Finally, (and probably next week) we will learn all about `Context` for our third refactor and ditch all of that `prop drilling` introduced in V1.

This lesson involves mutipler refactors and a few tutorial exercises, and will span 2 weeks. Please be sure to code along with me. Please be sure to attend this class and the next. Each version folder will have notes pertaining to the in class exercises in a README file within.

All three versions are valid solutions to the infamous coding test presented to candidates for a React Developer job. Why is something like a Todo List always part of the interview process? Because it covers C.R.U.D. -- Create, Read, Update, Delete actions.

## HW - Finalize Your Midterm Code by Friday 10/31

There is no HW this week except finalize your midterm code by Friday (optional). If you added in any significant changes to your code since your presentation last week, please email me to let me know what feature you added, or if you refactored/re-organized your code.
