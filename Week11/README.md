## HW - Final Project Proposal Presentations Next Tuesday!

It's Week11. Your final project presentations are Week14. You have a lot of new topics to incorporate like Context and data persistence with an API and Database.In the next few weeks we will be delving into the world of Redux.

One option, is to take our bare bones `Todo List App` and reskin it as something more specific. This would obviously include styling but more importantly, adding more input fields to make the usage of your app more specific. For example: you could turn the generic todo list into an exercise tracker. Maybe you add some color coding, or a way to filter or search existing todos. If you choose this option, you MUST add new fields! A simple styling pass will not suffice.

The other option is to build a new tool, game, or site that utilizes at least 2 topics from the second half of the semester. This option is more open, but make sure you dedmonstrate working knowledge of Context, JSON Server, and/or Redux! If you are unsure about your topic, feel free to reach out.
